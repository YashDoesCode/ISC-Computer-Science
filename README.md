## Content

- **Programming Languages:** The repository includes programs in languages such as Python, Java, and C++, among others.
- **Project Types:** You'll find various types of projects, including algorithms, data structures, and mini applications, each demonstrating key concepts from our syllabus.
- **Documentation:** Each program is accompanied by clear documentation, explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of the code.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and use this repository as a resource for your own studies!

Sincerely,
