# ISC Class XI & XII Programs Repository

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the programming projects and assignments completed during Class XI and XII of the ISC board. This collection showcases a variety of programs written in different programming languages, reflecting the concepts and skills we've learned in our coursework.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal reference and a resource for my friends. It aims to help us review and revisit the essential programming techniques and problem-solving strategies we encountered throughout our studies.

## Content

- **Programming Languages:** The repository includes programs in languages such as Python, Java, and C++, among others.
- **Project Types:** You'll find various types of projects, including algorithms, data structures, and mini applications, each demonstrating key concepts from our syllabus.
- **Documentation:** Each program is accompanied by clear documentation, explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage of the code.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and use this repository as a resource for your own studies!
